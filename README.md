# Cryptocurrency App

This is an application where we can view various cryptocurrencies, access their details and apply some sort filter like price, market cap, 24h volume, change, listed at.

I developed the application with Swift language and MVC architecture.
I used Storyboard and UIKit for design.
I used RapidAPI GeoDB Cities for data.
